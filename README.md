# 🌳 Arktree CLI

A command-line tool for generating and analyzing Ark trees with comprehensive statistics.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run directly
go run main.go generate 5

# Or build and run
go build -o arktree main.go
./arktree generate 5
```

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
# Install system-wide (requires sudo)
make install

# Install for current user only (no sudo)
make install-user

# See all available commands
make help
```

## 📖 Usage

```bash
# Show help
go run main.go --help

# Generate a tree with N leaves
go run main.go generate 5
go run main.go generate 100

# Show command help
go run main.go generate --help
```

## 📊 Features

The Arktree CLI generates Ark trees and provides detailed statistics including:

- **Tree Structure**: Total transactions and number of leaves
- **Branch Analysis**: Size distribution of branches (how many transactions each branch contains)
- **Broadcast Analysis**: Weight distribution showing how many transactions each user needs to broadcast
- **Performance Metrics**: Average, median, and distribution statistics for both size and broadcast weight

## 🔍 Understanding the Statistics

### Branch Size
- **Biggest Branch Size**: The maximum number of transactions in any single branch
- **Average/Median Branch Size**: Statistical measures of branch transaction counts
- **Branch Size Details**: Distribution showing how many branches have each transaction count

### Broadcast Weight
- **Most Tx to Broadcast**: The maximum number of transactions any user needs to broadcast
- **Avg/Median Tx to Broadcast**: Statistical measures of broadcast burden per user
- **Broadcast Weight Details**: Distribution showing how many branches require each broadcast count

The broadcast weight represents the computational and network burden on each cosigner. For example, if a transaction is shared by 3 cosigners, each cosigner broadcasts 1/3 of the transaction (weight = 1/3).
